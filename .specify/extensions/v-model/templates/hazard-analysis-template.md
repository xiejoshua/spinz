# Hazard Analysis (FMEA): [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `specs/[###-feature-name]/v-model/system-design.md`
**Standard**: ISO 14971 (Medical) / ISO 26262 (Automotive) / General-Purpose FMEA

## Overview

This document presents the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for [FEATURE NAME].
Every system component (`SYS-NNN`) from `system-design.md` is assessed for potential failure
modes across the operational states defined in the system design. Each hazard receives a
unique `HAZ-NNN` identifier and is linked to risk control measures (`REQ-NNN` / `SYS-NNN`),
enabling the traceability chain: Hazard → Mitigation → Requirement → Test Case (Matrix H).

## ID Schema

- **Hazard ID**: `HAZ-{NNN}` — 3-digit zero-padded, sequential (HAZ-001, HAZ-002, ...)
- **ID Lineage**: From `HAZ-001`, read the Mitigation column to find `REQ-NNN` / `SYS-NNN`.
  Consult `traceability-matrix.md` (Matrix H) for the full chain to verification test cases.

## Risk Matrix Definition

<!--
  Include the severity × likelihood risk matrix used for this analysis.
  Use the general-purpose matrix by default.
  If v-model-config.yml domain is set, use the domain-specific scale instead.
-->

### Severity Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| Catastrophic | Death or permanent injury; complete system destruction |
| Critical | Severe injury or major system damage; immediate intervention required |
| Serious | Moderate injury or significant degradation; medical attention needed |
| Minor | Slight injury or minor degradation; first aid sufficient |
| Negligible | No injury; cosmetic or inconvenience-level impact |

<!-- DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SCALES: Replace the above with domain scale when configured -->

<!--
### ISO 26262 ASIL Classification

| Severity | ASIL | Definition |
|----------|------|-----------|
| S3 | ASIL D | Life-threatening (survival uncertain) |
| S3 | ASIL C | Life-threatening (survival probable) |
| S2 | ASIL B | Severe injuries |
| S1 | ASIL A | Light injuries |
| S0 | QM | No injuries |
-->

<!--
### DO-178C Failure Conditions

| Failure Condition | DAL | Definition |
|-------------------|-----|-----------|
| Catastrophic | A | Prevents continued safe flight and landing |
| Hazardous | B | Large reduction in safety margins |
| Major | C | Significant reduction in safety margins |
| Minor | D | Slight reduction in safety margins |
| No Effect | E | No effect on operational capability |
-->

### Likelihood Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| Frequent | Likely to occur often; continuously experienced |
| Probable | Will occur several times; expected to occur |
| Occasional | Likely to occur sometime; can reasonably be expected |
| Remote | Unlikely but possible; could occur in the life of the system |
| Improbable | So unlikely it can be assumed it will not occur |

### Risk Matrix (Severity × Likelihood)

| | Frequent | Probable | Occasional | Remote | Improbable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Catastrophic** | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable |
| **Critical** | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable | Tolerable |
| **Serious** | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable | Tolerable | Tolerable |
| **Minor** | Undesirable | Tolerable | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable |
| **Negligible** | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable |

## Operational States Reference

<!--
  List all operational states extracted from system-design.md.
  If no explicit states are defined, use a single implicit "NORMAL" state
  and note the warning.
-->

| State | Description | Source |
|-------|------------|--------|
| [STATE_1] | [Description from system-design.md] | system-design.md §[section] |
| [STATE_2] | [Description from system-design.md] | system-design.md §[section] |

<!-- If no explicit states: -->
<!-- | NORMAL | Implicit default state (no operational states defined in system-design.md) | Implicit | -->
<!-- ⚠️ No operational states defined in system-design.md — using implicit NORMAL state. -->

## Hazard Register (FMEA)

<!--
  For EACH system component (SYS-NNN) in system-design.md:
  1. Identify failure modes (function, timing, value, interface failures)
  2. Evaluate severity across EVERY relevant operational state
  3. Create SEPARATE HAZ-NNN entries when severity differs by state
  4. Link every mitigation to at least one REQ-NNN or SYS-NNN

  RULES:
  - Every SYS-NNN must have at least one HAZ-NNN entry
  - Each HAZ entry has exactly 10 fields (columns below)
  - Mitigations MUST reference existing REQ-NNN or SYS-NNN identifiers
  - IDs are sequential, zero-padded, never renumbered
  - If no realistic failure mode exists: use "No identified failure mode" with
    Severity: Negligible and flag [HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED]
  - When updating (progressive deepening): append only, never modify existing entries
-->

| HAZ ID | Component | Failure Mode | Operational State | Effect | Severity | Likelihood | Risk Level | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|
| HAZ-001 | SYS-001 | [Failure description] | [STATE] | [System-level effect] | [Severity] | [Likelihood] | [Risk Level] | [REQ-NNN / SYS-NNN refs] | [Residual risk after mitigation] |
| HAZ-002 | SYS-001 | [Same failure, different state] | [STATE_2] | [Different effect at this state] | [Different severity] | [Likelihood] | [Risk Level] | [REQ-NNN / SYS-NNN refs] | [Residual risk] |

<!--
  Continue for ALL SYS-NNN components...

  Example of "no failure mode" entry:
  | HAZ-NNN | SYS-009 | No identified failure mode | ALL | N/A | Negligible | Improbable | Acceptable | N/A | Acceptable |
  [HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: Confirm no failure modes exist for SYS-009]
-->

## Progressive Deepening (Architecture-Level)

<!--
  Only include this section if architecture-design.md exists.
  Architecture-level hazards are APPENDED to the register above.
  They capture failure modes not visible at the SYS level:
  - Interface mismatches between ARCH modules
  - Protocol failures (handshake, timeout)
  - Data format incompatibilities
  - Race conditions (if applicable)

  If no new architecture-level hazards are found, state:
  "No additional architecture-level hazards identified."
-->

[Architecture-level hazard entries appended to the FMEA table above, or note that none were identified.]
