# V-Model Methodology Overview

## What is the V-Model?

The **V-Model** (Verification and Validation model) is a software development lifecycle (SDLC) model that emphasizes a strict, disciplined sequence: for every development phase, there is a directly corresponding testing phase. Instead of a linear waterfall, the process forms a **"V" shape** — development phases descend on the left, implementation sits at the bottom, and testing phases ascend on the right.

## Core Principle: Verification vs. Validation

- **Verification (Left Side):** "Are we building the product *right*?" — Reviews of documents, design, and code.
- **Validation (Right Side):** "Are we building the *right* product?" — Dynamic testing and execution.

The defining characteristic: **test plans are designed simultaneously with their corresponding development phase**, not after coding is complete.

## The V-Model Phases

```
Requirements ←————————————————————→ Acceptance Testing
    ↘                                      ↗
  System Design ←——————————————→ System Testing
      ↘                              ↗
    Architecture ←————————→ Integration Testing
        ↘                        ↗
      Module Design ←——→ Unit Testing
            ↘            ↗
          Implementation
```

### Left Side (Development/Verification)

| Phase | Output | Paired Test Phase |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Requirements Analysis** | Requirement Specification | Acceptance Testing |
| **System Design** | System Design Document | System Testing |
| **Architectural Design** | High-Level Design | Integration Testing |
| **Module Design** | Low-Level Design | Unit Testing |

### Right Side (Testing/Validation)

| Phase | Validates | What It Tests |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Module Design | Individual functions, classes, methods |
| **Integration Testing** | Architecture | Module interfaces, API contracts |
| **System Testing** | System Design | Complete system: performance, security, load |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Requirements | End-to-end user scenarios |

## Why the V-Model Matters for AI-Assisted Development

Modern AI coding tools ("vibe coding") often generate code without structured test plans, making it difficult to:
- Prove that every requirement was tested
- Trace a test failure back to a specific requirement
- Demonstrate compliance with safety standards

The V-Model Extension Pack enforces discipline by **requiring paired generation**: every development artifact (specification) automatically generates its testing counterpart (test plan), with traceable IDs linking them.

## The Four-Tier ID Schema

This extension uses a hierarchical ID scheme that encodes traceability directly:

| Tier | ID Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Requirement | `REQ-NNN` | REQ-001 | A discrete, testable requirement |
| Test Case | `ATP-NNN-X` | ATP-001-A | A logical test condition for REQ-001 |
| Scenario | `SCN-NNN-X#` | SCN-001-A1 | An executable BDD scenario for ATP-001-A |

Reading `SCN-001-A1` tells you: this scenario validates test case `ATP-001-A`, which tests requirement `REQ-001`. No lookup table needed. The same pattern repeats at system, architecture, and module levels.

## System Design ↔ System Testing Level

The second V-Model layer pairs **System Design** (left side) with **System Testing** (right side). While the Requirements ↔ Acceptance Testing level validates *what* the system must do, this level validates *how* the system is structured to do it.

### Standards Alignment

- **IEEE 1016:2009** (Software Design Description) defines 4 design viewpoints used to describe the system design:
  - **Decomposition View** — System broken into components/modules
  - **Dependency View** — Relationships and coupling between components
  - **Interface View** — External and internal interface contracts
  - **Data Design View** — Data models, schemas, and data flow

- **ISO 29119-4** (Test Techniques) specifies systematic techniques for system-level testing:
  - **Interface Contract Testing** — Validates interface specifications from the Interface View
  - **Boundary Value Analysis** — Tests edge cases for data ranges and limits
  - **Fault Injection** — Verifies error handling and resilience paths
  - **Equivalence Partitioning** — Groups inputs into classes to reduce test cases while maintaining coverage

### System-Level ID Schema

| Tier | ID Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Design Element | `SYS-NNN` | SYS-001 | A discrete system design element |
| Test Procedure | `STP-NNN-X` | STP-001-A | A test procedure for SYS-001 |
| Test Step | `STS-NNN-X#` | STS-001-A1 | An executable test step for STP-001-A |

Reading `STS-001-A1` tells you: this step validates test procedure `STP-001-A`, which tests design element `SYS-001`. The same self-documenting lineage as the requirements level.

## Architecture Design ↔ Integration Testing Level

The third V-Model layer pairs **Architecture Design** (left side) with **Integration Testing** (right side). While the System Design ↔ System Testing level validates *how* the system is structured, this level validates *how modules interact across boundaries* — interfaces, data flows, concurrency, and fault propagation between components.

### Standards Alignment

- **IEEE 42010:2022** (Architecture Description) / **Kruchten 4+1** define 4 architecture viewpoints used to describe module interactions:
  - **Logical View** — Module responsibilities, domain partitioning, and encapsulation boundaries
  - **Process View** — Concurrency, threading models, and inter-process communication
  - **Interface View** — Module-to-module API contracts, message schemas, and protocol bindings
  - **Data Flow View** — Data transformations, pipeline stages, and event propagation paths

- **ISO 29119-4** (Test Techniques) specifies systematic techniques for integration-level testing:
  - **Interface Contract Testing** — Validates module-to-module API contracts against the Interface View
  - **Data Flow Testing** — Verifies data transformations and propagation across module boundaries
  - **Interface Fault Injection** — Injects failures at integration points to verify resilience and error propagation
  - **Concurrency & Race Condition Testing** — Tests thread safety, deadlocks, and ordering guarantees from the Process View

### Architecture-Level ID Schema

| Tier | ID Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Architecture Element | `ARCH-NNN` | ARCH-001 | A discrete architecture module or component |
| Test Procedure | `ITP-NNN-X` | ITP-001-A | An integration test procedure for ARCH-001 |
| Test Step | `ITS-NNN-X#` | ITS-001-A1 | An executable integration test step for ITP-001-A |

Reading `ITS-001-A1` tells you: this step validates test procedure `ITP-001-A`, which tests architecture element `ARCH-001`. The same self-documenting lineage as the requirements and system levels.

### Matrix C: Integration Verification

Matrix C extends the traceability chain one level deeper:

- **Forward**: `SYS-NNN` → `ARCH-NNN` → `ITP-NNN-X` → `ITS-NNN-X#` (no gaps)
- **Backward**: Every integration test step → traces to an architecture element → traces to a system design element (no orphans)

Architecture modules tagged as `CROSS-CUTTING` (e.g., logging, authentication, configuration) are validated across all dependent modules rather than in isolation.

## Module Design ↔ Unit Testing Level

The fourth and innermost V-Model layer pairs **Module Design** (left side) with **Unit Testing** (right side). This is the bottom of the V — the most detailed level where individual functions, algorithms, and data structures are specified and tested in isolation.

### Standards Alignment

- **Module Design** specifies each module's internal behavior using 4 required views:
  - **Algorithmic / Logic View** — Pseudocode with typed parameters, return types, and control flow
  - **State Machine View** — Stateful modules define all states and transitions in `stateDiagram-v2`; stateless modules use "N/A — Stateless" bypass
  - **Internal Data Structures** — Typed structs, enums, constants, and constraints
  - **Error Handling & Return Codes** — Concrete error conditions, exceptions, and recovery actions

- **Unit Testing** uses white-box techniques targeting specific module views:
  - **Statement & Branch Coverage** — Exercises all code paths in the Algorithmic / Logic View
  - **Boundary Value Analysis** — Tests edge values for numeric or range-based inputs
  - **Equivalence Partitioning** — Groups inputs into representative equivalence classes
  - **State Transition Testing** — Covers valid/invalid state transitions for stateful modules
  - **Strict Isolation** — Every external dependency is mocked; no real DB, network, or hardware

### Module-Level ID Schema

| Tier | ID Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Module Design | `MOD-NNN` | MOD-001 | A discrete module within an architecture element |
| Test Procedure | `UTP-NNN-X` | UTP-001-A | A unit test procedure for MOD-001 |
| Test Scenario | `UTS-NNN-X#` | UTS-001-A1 | A unit test scenario for UTP-001-A |

Reading `UTS-001-A1` tells you: this scenario validates test procedure `UTP-001-A`, which tests module `MOD-001`. The same self-documenting lineage as all other levels.

### Matrix D: Implementation Verification

Matrix D extends the traceability chain to the innermost level:

- **Forward**: `ARCH-NNN` → `MOD-NNN` → `UTP-NNN-X` → `UTS-NNN-X#` (no gaps)
- **Backward**: Every unit test scenario → traces to a module → traces to an architecture element (no orphans)

Modules tagged as `[EXTERNAL]` (third-party or hardware-interfacing) are bypassed for unit test coverage. Modules tagged as `[CROSS-CUTTING]` (logging, diagnostics) are tested normally.

## Hazard Analysis (Cross-Cutting)

Hazard analysis is a **cross-cutting concern** — it operates alongside the V-Model hierarchy rather than within a single tier. In regulated industries (medical devices, automotive, aerospace), identifying and mitigating hazards is legally mandated before a product can ship.

### Standards Alignment

- **ISO 14971** (Medical Risk Management) requires systematic identification of hazards, estimation of associated risks, evaluation of risk acceptability, and control of risks.
- **ISO 26262 Part 9** (Automotive HARA) requires Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment at the concept and system levels.
- Both standards require hazards to be contextualized by **operational state** — the same failure mode may have dramatically different severity depending on the system's current mode of operation.

### Hazard Analysis ID Schema

| Tier | ID Format | Example | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Hazard | `HAZ-NNN` | HAZ-001 | A discrete hazard entry in the FMEA register |

The `HAZ-NNN` prefix is unique: it does not participate in the intra-level parent/child encoding used by design↔test pairs. Instead, each HAZ entry links to `SYS-NNN` components (via the FMEA Component column) and references `REQ-NNN` or `SYS-NNN` IDs in the Mitigation column. This creates a cross-cutting trace: Hazard → Mitigation → Requirement → Test Case.

### Matrix H: Hazard Traceability

Matrix H links hazards to their mitigation verification:

- **Forward**: Every `SYS-NNN` component → at least one `HAZ-NNN` hazard analyzed (no unanalyzed components)
- **Backward**: Every `HAZ-NNN` mitigation → references a valid `REQ-NNN` or `SYS-NNN` → traces to verification tests
- **State consistency**: Every operational state mentioned in hazard entries → exists in `system-design.md`

## When to Use the V-Model

The V-Model is ideal when:
- **Requirements are well-defined** and unlikely to change significantly (when they do, the `/speckit.v-model.impact-analysis` command identifies all suspect artifacts automatically)
- **Regulatory compliance** is required (medical, automotive, aerospace, industrial)
- **Safety is critical** — software failures could harm people or property
- **Audit trails** are mandatory — you need to prove every requirement was tested
- **The technology stack is known** — no major technical exploration needed
