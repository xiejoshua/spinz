## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Generate a **three-tier Acceptance Test Plan** that pairs every requirement (`REQ-NNN`) with:
1. **Test Cases** (`ATP-NNN-X`) — the logical validation conditions
2. **User Scenarios** (`SCN-NNN-X#`) — BDD-style (Given/When/Then) executable test paths

This command enforces the V-Model's core principle: **every development requirement has a simultaneously generated, paired testing artifact**. The output must achieve **100% coverage** — every requirement must have at least one test case, and every test case must have at least one executable scenario.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Setup

Run `{SCRIPT}` from the repository root. The `--require-reqs` flag ensures `requirements.md` exists.

Parse the JSON output for:
- `VMODEL_DIR`: Path to `specs/{feature}/v-model/` directory
- `REQUIREMENTS`: Path to `requirements.md`
- `AVAILABLE_DOCS`: Array of existing documents — check for `"acceptance-plan.md"` to detect existing plan

**Note on script paths**: The helper scripts (`diff-requirements`, `validate-requirement-coverage`) are in the same directory as the setup script. Derive the scripts directory from the `{SCRIPT}` path (i.e., its parent directory).

For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Context

1. **Load the template**: Read `templates/acceptance-plan-template.md` from the extension directory.
2. **Read requirements**: Parse `requirements.md` (`REQUIREMENTS` path) to extract all `REQ-NNN` items (all categories: REQ-, REQ-NF-, REQ-IF-, REQ-CN-).
3. **Load existing acceptance plan** (if `AVAILABLE_DOCS` contains `"acceptance-plan.md"`):
   - Read the existing `acceptance-plan.md` to preserve existing ATPs and SCNs.
   - Identify which REQs already have test cases.
   - Identify the existing ATP/SCN IDs to avoid duplicates.

### 3. Detect Incremental Changes (If Updating)

If an existing `acceptance-plan.md` is found, run the diff script to detect what changed:

```bash
{SCRIPTS_DIR}/diff-requirements.sh {VMODEL_DIR}
```
```powershell
{SCRIPTS_DIR}/diff-requirements.ps1 {VMODEL_DIR}
```

Where `{SCRIPTS_DIR}` is the parent directory of the `{SCRIPT}` path (or the equivalent PowerShell directory).

Parse the JSON output for:
- `added`: New REQ IDs that need ATPs/SCNs
- `modified`: Changed REQs whose ATPs/SCNs must be regenerated
- `removed`: Deleted REQs whose ATPs/SCNs should be flagged for removal

**Rules for incremental updates:**
- **Added REQs**: Generate new ATPs and SCNs, appending to the existing file.
- **Modified REQs**: Regenerate ATPs/SCNs for these REQs only. Replace the old sections in-place (match by REQ ID header).
- **Removed REQs**: Add a `[DEPRECATED]` tag to their ATPs/SCNs. Do NOT delete them — the user must confirm removal.
- **Unchanged REQs**: Do NOT touch their ATPs or SCNs. Preserve exactly as-is.
- **Never renumber** existing IDs.

If no existing acceptance plan exists, generate from scratch for all REQs.

### 4. Generate Test Cases and Scenarios (Batched)

Process requirements in **batches of 5** to prevent output token bloat and quality degradation. After each batch, append the results to `acceptance-plan.md`.

For **each requirement** in the current batch:

#### 4a. Generate Test Cases (`ATP-NNN-X`)

Create one or more test cases that together fully validate the requirement. Every test case MUST satisfy **all 4 quality criteria** defined in §5a.

- **ID format**: `ATP-{NNN}-{X}` where `NNN` matches the REQ number and `X` is a letter (A, B, C, ...).
- At minimum, generate:
  - **Happy path** (`-A`): The expected, successful behavior.
  - **Error/edge case** (`-B`, `-C`, ...): Boundary conditions, invalid inputs, failure modes.
- Each test case includes: ID, linked REQ, description, validation condition, and expected result.

#### 4b. Generate User Scenarios (`SCN-NNN-X#`)

For each test case, generate one or more **BDD-style executable scenarios**. Every scenario MUST satisfy **all 4 quality criteria** defined in §5b.

- **ID format**: `SCN-{NNN}-{X}{#}` where `NNN-X` matches the parent ATP and `#` is a number (1, 2, 3, ...).
- Use strict **Given/When/Then** format.
- Scenarios must be **concrete, declarative, and executable**.

#### 4c. Output Structure Per Requirement

```markdown
### Requirement Validation: REQ-{NNN} ({Short Description})

#### Test Case: ATP-{NNN}-A ({Test Name})
**Linked Requirement:** REQ-{NNN}
**Description:** {What is being validated}
**Validation Condition:** {Specific pass/fail condition}
**Expected Result:** {The definitive observable outcome that constitutes "pass"}

* **User Scenario: SCN-{NNN}-A1**
  * **Given** {precondition — explicit state, not assumptions}
  * **When** {single user action — declarative, not imperative}
  * **Then** {observable, verifiable outcome}

* **User Scenario: SCN-{NNN}-A2** *(if applicable)*
  * **Given** {different precondition}
  * **When** {same or different action}
  * **Then** {observable outcome}

#### Test Case: ATP-{NNN}-B ({Error/Edge Case Name})
**Linked Requirement:** REQ-{NNN}
**Description:** {What is being validated}
**Validation Condition:** {Specific pass/fail condition}
**Expected Result:** {The definitive observable outcome that constitutes "pass"}

* **User Scenario: SCN-{NNN}-B1**
  * **Given** {precondition}
  * **When** {invalid action or boundary condition}
  * **Then** {expected error handling behavior}
```

### 5. Quality Criteria (Mandatory)

#### 5a. Test Case Quality Criteria (ATP Tier)

Every test case MUST satisfy ALL 4 criteria. If a test case fails any criterion, rewrite it before including it.

**Criterion 1: Traceable**
The test case maps directly to a single requirement (`REQ-NNN`). If a test case doesn't trace back to a requirement, it is testing undefined behavior — this fails compliance audits. The `ATP-NNN-X` ID schema enforces this structurally.

**Criterion 2: Independent (Isolated)**
A test case MUST be able to run on its own, in any order. It cannot depend on the state left behind by a previous test case. The test must take responsibility for its own preconditions.

- ❌ "Verify the user can log out." (Implies login was performed by a previous test)
- ✅ "Verify a logged-in user can successfully log out and invalidate their session token." (Owns its preconditions)

**Check**: Can this test run first, last, or in the middle of the suite and still pass? If not, rewrite.

**Criterion 3: Repeatable (Deterministic)**
Running the test 100 times on an unchanged system MUST yield the exact same result 100 times. Eliminate variables like current time, live external data, non-deterministic ordering, or fluctuating database state.

- ❌ "Search for 'shoes' and verify 10 results are returned." (Fails when the database adds an 11th result)
- ✅ "Search for a specific SKU 'SHOE-123' and verify exactly 1 result matching the SKU is returned."

**Check**: Would this test produce a different result tomorrow without code changes? If yes, rewrite.

**Criterion 4: Clear Expected Result**
The test MUST have a **definitive, observable pass/fail state**. "It works" or "the system responds correctly" are NOT expected results.

- ❌ Expected result: "The feature works as expected."
- ✅ Expected result: "The system returns HTTP 200 with a JSON body containing `{"status": "success", "user_id": 42}`."

**Check**: Can a tester (human or automated) objectively determine pass vs. fail with no judgment calls? If not, rewrite.

#### 5b. Scenario Quality Criteria (SCN Tier / BDD)

Every scenario MUST satisfy ALL 4 criteria. These prevent the AI from writing brittle, untestable automation scripts.

**Criterion 1: Declarative, Not Imperative**
Scenarios describe **behavior and business intent**, not UI mechanics. Imperative scenarios break every time a developer changes a button color, CSS class, or page layout.

- ❌ (Imperative/Brittle):
  - `Given` I am on "/login.html"
  - `When` I type "user" into the field with ID "username-input"
  - `And` I click the blue button at x=150, y=300
- ✅ (Declarative/Resilient):
  - `Given` an existing user navigates to the login portal
  - `When` the user authenticates with valid credentials
  - `Then` the user is redirected to their secure dashboard

**Check**: Does this scenario reference specific HTML elements, CSS selectors, or pixel coordinates? If yes, rewrite at the behavioral level.

**Criterion 2: Single Action (The "One When" Rule)**
A scenario tests **one behavior** at a time. There should be only **one `When` statement** (possibly with `And` qualifiers for the same atomic action). If you have multiple unrelated `When`s, split into separate `SCN` blocks.

- ❌ `When` the user updates their profile `And` the user deletes their account. (Two separate behaviors)
- ✅ Split into `SCN-NNN-A1` (profile update) and `SCN-NNN-A2` (account deletion).

**Check**: Does the `When` section describe more than one independent user action? If yes, split.

**Criterion 3: Strict State Preconditions (`Given`)**
The `Given` step MUST explicitly set the stage. It assumes nothing about prior state.

- ❌ `Given` the user wants to buy an item. (Vague, subjective — what is the actual system state?)
- ✅ `Given` the user has an active session `And` their shopping cart contains 1 item with SKU "ITEM-001" priced at $29.99.

**Check**: Does the `Given` fully describe the system state needed for this test? Could a test automation framework set up this state from the `Given` alone? If not, add missing preconditions.

**Criterion 4: Observable Outcomes (`Then`)**
The outcome MUST be something the system can actually verify — a database state, an API response, specific UI text, a status code, or a measurable change.

- ❌ `Then` the system processes the payment quickly. (Not observable or measurable)
- ✅ `Then` the system returns HTTP 200 `And` the payment record in the database has status "Settled".

**Check**: Can an automated test assert on this outcome with zero human judgment? If not, rewrite with a concrete, observable condition.

### 6. Validate Coverage (Deterministic)

After generating all batches, run the coverage validation script:

```bash
{SCRIPTS_DIR}/validate-requirement-coverage.sh --json {VMODEL_DIR}
```
```powershell
{SCRIPTS_DIR}/validate-requirement-coverage.ps1 -Json {VMODEL_DIR}
```

Parse the JSON output for:
- `has_gaps`: Whether any coverage gaps exist
- `reqs_without_atp`: List of REQ IDs missing test cases
- `atps_without_scn`: List of ATP IDs missing scenarios
- `orphaned_atps`: ATPs referencing non-existent REQs
- `req_coverage_pct`: Requirement-to-test-case coverage percentage
- `atp_coverage_pct`: Test-case-to-scenario coverage percentage

**Coverage gate** (MANDATORY):
- If `has_gaps` is true: You MUST generate the missing items. Use the gap report to target exactly the missing REQs/ATPs. Do NOT regenerate items that already exist.
- Re-run the validation script after generating missing items.
- Repeat until `has_gaps` is false (maximum 3 iterations).
- If coverage < 100% after 3 iterations: Report the remaining gaps to the user and flag them in the document with `[COVERAGE GAP: missing ATP/SCN]`.

### 7. Write Coverage Summary

Append a coverage summary section to the end of `acceptance-plan.md`:

```markdown
---

## Coverage Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Requirements | {N} |
| Total Test Cases (ATP) | {N} |
| Total Scenarios (SCN) | {N} |
| REQ → ATP Coverage | {N}% |
| ATP → SCN Coverage | {N}% |

**Validation Status**: ✅ Full Coverage / ❌ Gaps Remaining (see flagged items)
**Generated**: {DATE}
**Validated by**: `validate-requirement-coverage.sh` (deterministic)
```

### 8. Report Completion

Display a summary:
- Total ATPs and SCNs generated
- Coverage percentage at each tier
- Any gaps or issues that need attention
- Path to the generated file
- Next step: Recommend running `/speckit.v-model.trace` to build the traceability matrix

If processing was batched, remind the user that all batches are complete and the full file has been assembled.

## Operating Constraints

### Three-Tier ID Schema

The ID encodes its full lineage — no separate mapping needed:
- `SCN-001-A1` → belongs to `ATP-001-A` → validates `REQ-001`
- `SCN-NF-001-B2` → belongs to `ATP-NF-001-B` → validates `REQ-NF-001`

### Append-Only Behavior

- **Never overwrite** existing ATPs or SCNs for unchanged requirements
- **Never renumber** existing IDs
- When adding new items, append after existing content
- When modifying items for changed REQs, replace in-place by matching the `### Requirement Validation: REQ-NNN` header

### Batching Strategy

- Process 5 requirements per batch to prevent token limit issues
- After each batch, write/append results to `acceptance-plan.md`
- If there are remaining requirements, prompt: "Batch {N} complete ({processed}/{total} requirements). Type 'continue' to process the next batch."
- The coverage validation runs only after ALL batches are complete
