# System Test Plan: Architecture Design ↔ Integration Testing

**Feature Branch**: `003-architecture-integration`
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Status**: Approved
**Source**: `specs/003-architecture-integration/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

This document defines the System Test Plan for the Architecture Design ↔ Integration Testing feature (v0.3.0). Every system component in `system-design.md` has one or more Test Cases (STP), and every Test Case has one or more executable System Scenarios (STS) in technical BDD format (Given/When/Then).

System tests verify **architectural behavior**, not user journeys. Language must be technical and component-oriented. The feature under test comprises 2 new LLM agent commands, 2 templates, 1 trace command extension, 2 matrix builder script extensions (Bash + PowerShell), 2 validation scripts (Bash + PowerShell), setup script extensions, an extension manifest update, and a CI evaluation suite extension.

## ID Schema

- **System Test Case**: `STP-{NNN}-{X}` — where NNN matches the parent SYS, X is a letter suffix (A, B, C...)
- **System Test Scenario**: `STS-{NNN}-{X}{#}` — nested under the parent STP, with numeric suffix (1, 2, 3...)
- Example: `STS-001-A1` → Scenario 1 of Test Case A verifying SYS-001

## ISO 29119 Test Techniques

Each test case MUST identify its technique by name:
- **Interface Contract Testing** — Verifies API contracts from the Interface View
- **Boundary Value Analysis** — Tests data limits from the Data Design View
- **Equivalence Partitioning** — Tests representative data classes
- **Fault Injection** — Tests failure propagation from the Dependency View

## System Tests

### Component Verification: SYS-001 (Architecture Design Command)

**Parent Requirements**: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006, REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-012, REQ-013, REQ-021, REQ-041, REQ-045, REQ-NF-002, REQ-IF-001, REQ-CN-001

#### Test Case: STP-001-A (File I/O Contract Compliance)

**Technique**: Interface Contract Testing
**Target View**: Interface View
**Description**: Verifies that the architecture design command reads exclusively from `{FEATURE_DIR}/v-model/system-design.md` and produces `{FEATURE_DIR}/v-model/architecture-design.md` containing `ARCH-NNN` identifiers with four mandatory 42010/4+1 views (Logical, Process, Interface, Data Flow), many-to-many SYS↔ARCH traceability, `[CROSS-CUTTING]` tagging, derived module flagging, and anti-pattern warnings for incomplete interface contracts.

* **System Scenario: STS-001-A1**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` containing 12 `SYS-NNN` components in the Decomposition View
  * **When** the command executes generation
  * **Then** the command produces `architecture-design.md` containing `ARCH-NNN` identifiers (3-digit zero-padded), a Logical View with "Parent System Components" fields, a Process View with Mermaid sequence diagrams, an Interface View with inputs/outputs/exceptions per module, and a Data Flow View with transformation chains

* **System Scenario: STS-001-A2**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` containing `SYS-NNN` components with many-to-many relationships
  * **When** the command maps SYS components to ARCH modules
  * **Then** each business-logic `ARCH-NNN` traces to one or more `SYS-NNN` via the "Parent System Components" field, and infrastructure modules are tagged `[CROSS-CUTTING]` with a rationale instead of a `SYS-NNN` reference

* **System Scenario: STS-001-A3**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command identifies a technical module that is neither traceable to any `SYS-NNN` nor qualifies as `[CROSS-CUTTING]`
  * **When** the command processes the module during generation
  * **Then** the command flags it as `[DERIVED MODULE: description]` rather than silently creating an `ARCH-NNN` entry

* **System Scenario: STS-001-A4**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command produces an `ARCH-NNN` module with missing inputs, outputs, or exceptions in the Interface View
  * **When** the command evaluates interface contract completeness
  * **Then** the command emits an anti-pattern warning identifying the module with the incomplete contract

#### Test Case: STP-001-B (Large-Scale Input Handling)

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies that the architecture design command handles input files at and beyond the 50-SYS threshold without truncation, data loss, or degraded output quality in the generated `architecture-design.md`.

* **System Scenario: STS-001-B1**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` containing exactly 50 `SYS-NNN` identifiers
  * **When** the command executes generation
  * **Then** the generated `architecture-design.md` contains at least one `ARCH-NNN` for each of the 50 `SYS-NNN` components, with no truncation of identifiers, views, or traceability fields

* **System Scenario: STS-001-B2**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` containing 51 `SYS-NNN` identifiers
  * **When** the command executes generation
  * **Then** the generated `architecture-design.md` contains complete coverage for all 51 components with identical output quality to the 50-component case

#### Test Case: STP-001-C (Dependency Failure Graceful Degradation)

**Technique**: Fault Injection
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies that the architecture design command degrades gracefully when its dependencies (SYS-004 template, SYS-009 setup) are unavailable or when input is empty.

* **System Scenario: STS-001-C1**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command is invoked and `architecture-design-template.md` (SYS-004) is not found in the `templates/` directory
  * **When** the command attempts template loading
  * **Then** the command reports an error to the user indicating the template file was not found and does not produce a malformed `architecture-design.md`

* **System Scenario: STS-001-C2**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` that is empty (zero bytes)
  * **When** the command parses the input for `SYS-NNN` identifiers
  * **Then** the command fails gracefully with the message "No system components found in system-design.md — cannot generate architecture design" and does not produce output

* **System Scenario: STS-001-C3**
  * **Given** the architecture-design command receives `system-design.md` containing valid Markdown but zero `SYS-NNN` identifiers
  * **When** the command parses the input for `SYS-NNN` identifiers
  * **Then** the command fails gracefully with the message "No system components found in system-design.md — cannot generate architecture design" and does not produce output

* **System Scenario: STS-001-C4**
  * **Given** the setup script (SYS-009) returns a non-zero exit code because `system-design.md` is missing at the expected path
  * **When** the architecture-design command invokes setup with `--require-system-design`
  * **Then** the command does not proceed with generation and surfaces the setup error message

* **System Scenario: STS-009-A3**
  * **Given** `setup-v-model.sh` is invoked and `architecture-design.md` and `integration-test.md` both exist in `{FEATURE_DIR}/v-model/`
  * **When** the setup script detects available documents
  * **Then** the `AVAILABLE_DOCS` field in the JSON output includes both `architecture-design.md` and `integration-test.md`

#### Test Case: STP-009-B (Backward Compatibility)

**Technique**: Fault Injection
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies that existing v0.2.0 invocations of the setup scripts produce unchanged behavior after the v0.3.0 extensions.

* **System Scenario: STS-009-B1**
  * **Given** `setup-v-model.sh` is invoked without the `--require-system-design` flag and without any architecture-level artifacts present
  * **When** the setup script executes with v0.2.0-style arguments
  * **Then** the script produces identical output and exit code behavior as v0.2.0, with no errors or warnings related to missing architecture-level artifacts

* **System Scenario: STS-009-B2**
  * **Given** `setup-v-model.ps1` is invoked without the `-RequireSystemDesign` parameter and without architecture-level artifacts
  * **When** the setup script executes with v0.2.0-style arguments
  * **Then** the script produces identical output and exit code behavior as v0.2.0

### Component Verification: SYS-010 (Architecture Coverage Validation Script — PowerShell)

**Parent Requirements**: REQ-CN-003, REQ-IF-003, REQ-IF-004

#### Test Case: STP-010-A (CLI Contract Compliance — PowerShell)

**Technique**: Interface Contract Testing
**Target View**: Interface View
**Description**: Verifies that `validate-architecture-coverage.ps1` accepts the same three positional file path arguments and `-Json` flag as the Bash version (SYS-003), with identical output format and exit code behavior.

* **System Scenario: STS-010-A1**
  * **Given** `validate-architecture-coverage.ps1` receives three file paths: `system-design.md` (containing 5 SYS identifiers), `architecture-design.md` (full ARCH coverage), and `integration-test.md` (full ITP coverage)
  * **When** the script executes forward and backward coverage validation
  * **Then** the script outputs a coverage summary in the same format as SYS-003 and exits with code 0

* **System Scenario: STS-010-A2**
  * **Given** `validate-architecture-coverage.ps1` receives three file paths where a coverage gap exists and the `-Json` flag
  * **When** the script executes all coverage checks
  * **Then** the script outputs a JSON-structured report with identical schema to the `--json` output of `validate-architecture-coverage.sh` (SYS-003) and exits with code 1

#### Test Case: STP-010-B (Cross-Platform Parity with Bash)

**Technique**: Fault Injection
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies that the PowerShell validation script (SYS-010) produces identical results to the Bash validation script (SYS-003) for the same test fixture suite, ensuring no behavioral divergence.

* **System Scenario: STS-010-B1**
  * **Given** `validate-architecture-coverage.ps1` and `validate-architecture-coverage.sh` both receive the same fixture files containing full coverage, coverage gaps, orphaned identifiers, and gaps in ARCH numbering
  * **When** both scripts execute all validation checks
  * **Then** both scripts produce identical pass/fail verdicts, identical gap report content (after line-ending normalization), and identical exit codes for each fixture

* **System Scenario: STS-010-B2**
  * **Given** `validate-architecture-coverage.ps1` receives files with a circular dependency in the Process View
  * **When** the script executes circular dependency detection
  * **Then** the script detects the circular dependency, reports the involved ARCH identifiers, and exits with code 1 without hanging — matching the behavior of SYS-003

### Component Verification: SYS-011 (Extension Manifest Update)

**Parent Requirements**: REQ-CN-002

#### Test Case: STP-011-A (Manifest Version and Registration)

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies that `extension.yml` and `catalog-entry.json` contain version `0.3.0` and register exactly 7 commands (5 existing + 2 new: `architecture-design`, `integration-test`) and 1 hook.

* **System Scenario: STS-011-A1**
  * **Given** `extension.yml` is read from the repository root
  * **When** the version field is inspected
  * **Then** the version value is exactly `0.3.0`

* **System Scenario: STS-011-A2**
  * **Given** `extension.yml` is read from the repository root
  * **When** the registered commands list is inspected
  * **Then** the manifest registers exactly 7 commands including `architecture-design` and `integration-test` as the 2 new entries, and exactly 1 hook

* **System Scenario: STS-011-A3**
  * **Given** `catalog-entry.json` is read from the repository
  * **When** the version field is inspected
  * **Then** the version value is exactly `0.3.0`

### Component Verification: SYS-012 (CI Evaluation Suite Extension)

**Parent Requirements**: REQ-NF-005

#### Test Case: STP-012-A (Output Regression Detection)

**Technique**: Fault Injection
**Target View**: Dependency View
**Description**: Verifies that the CI evaluation suite detects quality regressions in `/speckit.v-model.architecture-design` and `/speckit.v-model.integration-test` command outputs when SYS-001 or SYS-002 output format changes.

* **System Scenario: STS-012-A1**
  * **Given** the CI evaluation suite receives `architecture-design.md` output from SYS-001 that meets v0.2.0 quality thresholds (correct ARCH-NNN identifiers, complete four-view structure, valid traceability)
  * **When** the evaluation suite executes its validation assertions
  * **Then** the suite reports a pass verdict with all quality checks satisfied

* **System Scenario: STS-012-A2**
  * **Given** the CI evaluation suite receives `architecture-design.md` output from SYS-001 that is missing the Interface View section
  * **When** the evaluation suite executes its validation assertions
  * **Then** the suite reports a failure verdict identifying the missing Interface View as a structural regression

* **System Scenario: STS-012-A3**
  * **Given** the CI evaluation suite receives `integration-test.md` output from SYS-002 that meets v0.2.0 quality thresholds
  * **When** the evaluation suite executes its validation assertions
  * **Then** the suite reports a pass verdict with all quality checks satisfied

#### Test Case: STP-012-B (Mermaid Syntax Validation)

**Technique**: Boundary Value Analysis
**Target View**: Data Design View
**Description**: Verifies that the CI evaluation suite validates the syntactic correctness of generated Mermaid diagrams in the Process View and treats broken Mermaid syntax as a structural failure.

* **System Scenario: STS-012-B1**
  * **Given** the CI evaluation suite receives `architecture-design.md` containing a Process View with syntactically valid Mermaid sequence diagrams
  * **When** the evaluation suite executes Mermaid syntax validation
  * **Then** the suite reports no Mermaid-related failures

* **System Scenario: STS-012-B2**
  * **Given** the CI evaluation suite receives `architecture-design.md` containing a Process View with a broken Mermaid diagram (e.g., unclosed `sequenceDiagram` block, invalid arrow syntax)
  * **When** the evaluation suite executes Mermaid syntax validation
  * **Then** the suite treats the broken Mermaid syntax as a structural failure and reports the specific diagram location
