# Architecture Design: Module Design ↔ Unit Testing

**Feature Branch**: `004-module-unit-testing`
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Status**: Approved
**Source**: `specs/004-module-unit/v-model/system-design.md`

## Overview

This document decomposes the 12 system components of the V-Model Extension Pack v0.4.0 into 17 architecture modules following the IEEE 42010/Kruchten 4+1 framework. The decomposition follows natural code/file boundaries within the extension: Markdown agent prompts are split into orchestrators (step execution) and generators (content production); validation scripts are split into forward and backward coverage parsers; the CI evaluation suite is split into structural and semantic engines. One cross-cutting module captures the shared tag-routing logic (`[EXTERNAL]`, `[CROSS-CUTTING]`, `[DERIVED MODULE]`) used across commands and validators. Each architecture module maps many-to-many to parent system components, and every SYS-NNN from the system design appears as a parent in at least one ARCH-NNN. No safety-critical sections are generated (no `v-model-config.yml` domain configuration detected).

## ID Schema

- **Architecture Module**: `ARCH-NNN` — sequential identifier for each module
- **Parent System Components**: Comma-separated `SYS-NNN` list per module (many-to-many)
- **Cross-Cutting Tag**: `[CROSS-CUTTING]` for infrastructure/utility modules not traceable to a specific SYS
- Example: `ARCH-003` with Parent System Components `SYS-001, SYS-004` — module serves both components
- Example: `ARCH-017 [CROSS-CUTTING]` — shared tag-routing logic used across commands and validators

## Logical View — Component Breakdown (IEEE 42010 / Kruchten 4+1)

| ARCH ID | Name | Description | Parent System Components | Type |
|---------|------|-------------|--------------------------|------|
| ARCH-001 | Module Design Prompt Orchestrator | Executes the `/speckit.v-model.module-design` command step-by-step: invokes setup script with `--require-module-design` prerequisite flag, loads `architecture-design.md`, loads the template (ARCH-005), delegates per-module generation to ARCH-002, delegates tag-based routing to ARCH-017, invokes `validate-module-coverage.sh` (ARCH-007/ARCH-008) as a post-generation coverage gate (forward-only partial validation since unit-test.md does not yet exist at this stage), and writes `module-design.md` to the feature's `v-model/` directory. Enforces the strict translator constraint by rejecting any `MOD-NNN` not traceable to an `ARCH-NNN` in the input, and flags untraceable modules as `[DERIVED MODULE: description]`. Fails gracefully with a clear error message when `architecture-design.md` is empty or contains zero `ARCH-NNN` identifiers. | SYS-001 | Component |
| ARCH-002 | Module Four-View Generator | Generates the four mandatory module design views for each `MOD-NNN`: (1) Algorithmic/Logic View with fenced ` ```pseudocode ``` ` blocks containing explicit branches, loops, and decisions; (2) State Machine View using Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` for stateful modules or a broad-regex-matchable stateless bypass string (`(?i)N/?A.*Stateless`) for pure functions; (3) Internal Data Structures with explicit local variable types, sizes, and constraints; (4) Error Handling & Return Codes mapped to Architecture Interface View contracts. Populates the "Target Source File(s)" property (comma-separated for header/implementation pairs) and the "Parent Architecture Modules" field for many-to-many ARCH↔MOD traceability. Conditionally includes safety-critical sections (Complexity Constraints, Memory Management, Single Entry/Exit) when domain configuration is present. | SYS-001, SYS-004 | Component |
| ARCH-003 | Unit Test Prompt Orchestrator | Executes the `/speckit.v-model.unit-test` command step-by-step: invokes setup script with `--require-unit-test` prerequisite flag, loads `module-design.md`, loads the template (ARCH-006), delegates per-module test generation to ARCH-004, delegates tag routing to ARCH-017 (skipping `[EXTERNAL]` modules), invokes `validate-module-coverage.sh` (ARCH-007/ARCH-008) as a post-generation coverage gate (full validation mode since both `module-design.md` and `unit-test.md` now exist), and writes `unit-test.md` to the feature's `v-model/` directory. Enforces the strict translator constraint: test cases target only internal module logic documented in `module-design.md`. | SYS-002 | Component |
| ARCH-004 | White-Box Technique Engine | Selects and applies ISO 29119-4 white-box testing techniques for each `MOD-NNN`: Statement & Branch Coverage (driven by Algorithmic/Logic View), Boundary Value Analysis for scalar types or Equivalence Partitioning for discrete non-scalar types (driven by Internal Data Structures), Strict Isolation via Dependency & Mock Registry (driven by Architecture Interface View — includes hardware interfaces such as GPIO and memory-mapped registers), State Transition Testing covering every transition including invalid ones (driven by State Machine View). Generates `UTP-NNN-X` test cases with explicit technique naming and view anchoring, and `UTS-NNN-X#` scenarios in Arrange/Act/Assert format with white-box implementation-oriented language. Populates the Dependency & Mock Registry table per test case, using "None — module is self-contained" for dependency-free modules. Conditionally includes MC/DC truth tables and variable-level fault injection for safety-critical domains. ID lineage is regex-parseable to `MOD-NNN`; ARCH resolution requires file lookup due to many-to-many. | SYS-002, SYS-005 | Component |
| ARCH-005 | Module Design Template | Markdown template file (`module-design-template.md`) defining the required output structure for `module-design.md`. Contains section headers and HTML comment guidance for each of the four mandatory views, the Target Source File(s) property field, Parent Architecture Modules field, `[CROSS-CUTTING]` and `[EXTERNAL]` handling sections, and conditional safety-critical placeholders (Complexity Constraints, Memory Management, Single Entry/Exit). Read by ARCH-001 during generation. | SYS-004 | Library |
| ARCH-006 | Unit Test Template | Markdown template file (`unit-test-template.md`) defining the required output structure for `unit-test.md`. Contains section headers and HTML comment guidance for the three-tier MOD→UTP-NNN-X→UTS-NNN-X# hierarchy, technique naming, view anchoring, Arrange/Act/Assert format, Dependency & Mock Registry table (with hardware interface guidance), `[EXTERNAL]` skip notation, and conditional safety-critical placeholders (MC/DC truth tables, Variable-Level Fault Injection). Read by ARCH-003 during generation. | SYS-005 | Library |
| ARCH-007 | Forward Coverage Parser | Component within `validate-module-coverage.sh` that validates forward coverage: every `ARCH-NNN` (including `[CROSS-CUTTING]`) in `architecture-design.md` has at least one `MOD-NNN` in `module-design.md`. Resolves ARCH ancestry from the "Parent Architecture Modules" field in `module-design.md` (not from the MOD ID string) due to many-to-many ARCH↔MOD relationships. Accepts gaps in MOD numbering without false positives. Uses regex-based parsing consistent with v0.3.0's `validate-architecture-coverage.sh`. | SYS-003 | Utility |
| ARCH-008 | Backward Coverage Parser | Component within `validate-module-coverage.sh` that validates backward coverage: every `MOD-NNN` (except `[EXTERNAL]`) has at least one `UTP-NNN-X` in `unit-test.md`. Implements partial validation: when `unit-test.md` is absent, the parser is entirely skipped and the script exits based on forward coverage alone. Detects orphaned UTP identifiers (UTP whose parent MOD does not exist). The `[EXTERNAL]` tag is the sole recognized bypass — `[COTS]` and other variants are ignored. Outputs human-readable gap reports with specific IDs and supports `--json` mode. Exit code: 0 on pass, 1 on failure. | SYS-003 | Utility |
| ARCH-009 | Module Coverage Validator (PowerShell) | PowerShell script (`validate-module-coverage.ps1`) implementing identical forward coverage parsing (ARCH-007), backward coverage parsing (ARCH-008), partial validation, `[EXTERNAL]` bypass, orphan detection, exit codes, and output formatting as the Bash version. Accepts the same three positional file path arguments and `-Json` flag. Passes the same test fixture suite. | SYS-010 | Utility |
| ARCH-010 | Matrix D Data Extractor (Bash) | Extension to `build-matrix.sh` that parses three files — `architecture-design.md` (for ARCH→SYS lineage resolution), `module-design.md` (for ARCH→MOD mappings via "Parent Architecture Modules" field), and `unit-test.md` (for MOD→UTP→UTS mappings) — to extract structured ARCH→MOD→UTP→UTS data. Annotates each ARCH-NNN with its parent SYS-NNN references in parentheses; outputs `([CROSS-CUTTING])` for cross-cutting ARCH modules and `[EXTERNAL]` annotations with "N/A — External" for UTP/UTS on external modules. Computes independent coverage percentages matching `validate-module-coverage.sh` output. | SYS-007 | Utility |
| ARCH-011 | Matrix D Table Renderer | Extension to the `/speckit.v-model.trace` command prompt that consumes structured data from ARCH-010 (Bash) or ARCH-012 (PowerShell) and renders Matrix D as a Markdown table. Produces Matrix A, B, C, and D as separate tables with independent coverage percentages. Builds progressively: A alone → A+B → A+B+C → A+B+C+D depending on available artifacts. Backward compatible: when `module-design.md` and `unit-test.md` are absent, produces v0.3.0 output (Matrix A+B+C only, no Matrix D, no warning). Supports partial Matrix D: MOD column populated, UTP/UTS columns display "Unit test plan not yet generated" when `unit-test.md` is absent. | SYS-006 | Component |
| ARCH-012 | Matrix D Data Extractor (PowerShell) | Extension to `build-matrix.ps1` with identical three-file parsing logic, ARCH→SYS annotation, `[CROSS-CUTTING]`/`[EXTERNAL]` handling, and coverage percentage computation as the Bash version (ARCH-010). Ensures cross-platform parity for enterprise Windows teams. | SYS-008 | Utility |
| ARCH-013 | Setup Module-Level Flag Handler | Extension to `setup-v-model.sh` and `setup-v-model.ps1` adding `--require-module-design` and `--require-unit-test` flags that verify the respective files exist before returning JSON. Extends `AVAILABLE_DOCS` array detection to include `module-design.md` and `unit-test.md`. Preserves backward compatibility: existing v0.3.0 invocations (without the new flags) produce unchanged JSON output and unchanged exit behavior. | SYS-009 | Utility |
| ARCH-014 | Extension Manifest v0.4.0 Registrar | Updates to `extension.yml` bumping the version to `0.4.0`, registering exactly 9 commands (7 existing + `module-design` + `unit-test`) and 1 hook, and adding `MOD`, `UTP`, `UTS` to the recognized `id_prefixes` list. | SYS-011 | Component |
| ARCH-015 | Structural Evaluation Engine | Python-based structural validation for module-design and unit-test command outputs. Assertions include: fenced ` ```pseudocode ``` ` block presence for every non-`[EXTERNAL]` MOD, technique naming for every UTP, Dependency & Mock Registry table presence for every UTP, `[EXTERNAL]` bypass correctness (no UTP generated for external modules), State Machine View validity (Mermaid for stateful, broad regex `(?i)N/?A.*Stateless` for stateless), Target Source File(s) field presence, and Parent Architecture Modules field presence. Integrated into CI via `evals.yml` workflow. | SYS-012 | Component |
| ARCH-016 | Semantic Quality Evaluator | LLM-as-judge evaluation component that assesses the semantic quality and concreteness of pseudocode in `module-design.md`. Evaluates whether pseudocode contains explicit branches, loops, decisions, and implementation-level detail (not vague prose like "process appropriately"). Reports pass/fail with specific module identifiers for failures. Integrated into CI alongside structural evaluations (ARCH-015). | SYS-012 | Component |
| ARCH-017 | Tag Routing Logic | Shared logic for routing `[EXTERNAL]`, `[CROSS-CUTTING]`, and `[DERIVED MODULE]` tags across commands and validators. In the module design command (ARCH-001): `[CROSS-CUTTING]` ARCH modules are fully decomposed with inherited tag; `[EXTERNAL]` ARCH modules produce wrapper-only documentation; unroutable modules are flagged as `[DERIVED MODULE: description]`. In validation scripts (ARCH-007/ARCH-008): `[EXTERNAL]` is the sole bypass tag; `[CROSS-CUTTING]` modules require full forward coverage; `[COTS]` is not recognized. In Matrix D rendering (ARCH-011): `[CROSS-CUTTING]` displays `([CROSS-CUTTING])` instead of SYS annotation; `[EXTERNAL]` shows "N/A — External" in UTP/UTS columns. Ensures a single canonical tag vocabulary across all 12 system components. | [CROSS-CUTTING] — Infrastructure routing logic shared by commands (ARCH-001, ARCH-003), validators (ARCH-007, ARCH-008, ARCH-009), matrix builders (ARCH-010, ARCH-012), and trace rendering (ARCH-011). Cannot be attributed to a single SYS. | Utility |

```

**Concurrency Model**: Sequential — single-threaded LLM agent prompt execution. No parallelism within the generation pipeline; modules are processed one at a time in ARCH-NNN order.
**Synchronization Points**: Coverage gate (ARCH-007) must complete before the orchestrator reports final status.

```

**Concurrency Model**: Sequential — single-threaded LLM agent prompt execution. Technique selection (ARCH-004) processes modules serially.
**Synchronization Points**: Both forward (ARCH-007) and backward (ARCH-008) validators must complete before final status.

    end
    TR->>TR: Render Matrix A + B + C (unchanged)
    TR-->>U: traceability-matrix.md with progressive matrices
```

**Concurrency Model**: Sequential — deterministic script execution. Matrix D data extraction is a single-pass regex parse over three files.
**Synchronization Points**: Matrix D data extraction must complete before table rendering. All four matrices rendered sequentially (A → B → C → D).

| Output | Routing decision | Enum/String | `decompose_full`, `wrapper_only`, `skip_utp`, `flag_derived`, `bypass_validation` | Context-dependent: commands, validators, and matrix builders consume different subsets. |

## Data Flow View — Data Transformation Chains (Kruchten 4+1)

### Data Flow: Module Design Generation

| Stage | Module | Input Format | Transformation | Output Format |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | ARCH-013 | CLI flags + file system | Verify prerequisites, detect available docs | JSON `{VMODEL_DIR, AVAILABLE_DOCS, ...}` |
| 2 | ARCH-001 | JSON + `architecture-design.md` (Markdown) | Parse ARCH-NNN identifiers from Logical View table | In-memory ARCH module list with four views per module |
| 3 | ARCH-017 | ARCH-NNN tag string | Classify tag: `[EXTERNAL]` → wrapper_only, `[CROSS-CUTTING]` → decompose_full, none → decompose_full | Routing decision per module |
| 4 | ARCH-002 | ARCH module data + template structure | Generate four views per MOD: pseudocode, state machine, data structures, error handling | Markdown text per MOD-NNN section |
| 5 | ARCH-001 | MOD-NNN sections + template | Assemble into complete document | `module-design.md` (Markdown file) |
| 6 | ARCH-007 | `architecture-design.md` + `module-design.md` | Regex-parse ARCH-NNN and MOD-NNN IDs, cross-reference via "Parent Architecture Modules" field | Coverage report (stdout text or JSON) |

### Data Flow: Unit Test Generation

| Stage | Module | Input Format | Transformation | Output Format |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | ARCH-013 | CLI flags + file system | Verify prerequisites, detect available docs | JSON `{VMODEL_DIR, AVAILABLE_DOCS, ...}` |
| 2 | ARCH-003 | JSON + `module-design.md` (Markdown) | Parse MOD-NNN identifiers and four views per module | In-memory MOD module list with views and data types |
| 3 | ARCH-017 | MOD-NNN tag string | Classify: `[EXTERNAL]` → skip_utp, else → generate | Routing decision per module |
| 4 | ARCH-004 | MOD views + Internal Data Structures types | Select technique: scalar → BVA, non-scalar → EP, stateful → State Transition, all → Statement/Branch | UTP-NNN-X + UTS-NNN-X# Markdown text with mock registry |
| 5 | ARCH-003 | UTP/UTS sections + template | Assemble into complete document | `unit-test.md` (Markdown file) |
| 6 | ARCH-007 + ARCH-008 | `architecture-design.md` + `module-design.md` + `unit-test.md` | Regex-parse all IDs, cross-reference forward + backward + orphans | Full coverage report (stdout text or JSON) |

### Data Flow: Matrix D Trace Generation

| Stage | Module | Input Format | Transformation | Output Format |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | ARCH-011 | File existence check via AVAILABLE_DOCS | Determine which matrices to produce (progressive) | Matrix generation plan (A, A+B, A+B+C, or A+B+C+D) |
| 2 | ARCH-010 | Three Markdown files (architecture-design, module-design, unit-test) | Regex-parse ARCH→SYS from Logical View, MOD→ARCH from "Parent Architecture Modules", UTP/UTS from unit-test | Structured ARCH→MOD→UTP→UTS text with annotations |
| 3 | ARCH-017 | ARCH-NNN and MOD-NNN tags | Annotate: `[CROSS-CUTTING]` → `([CROSS-CUTTING])`, `[EXTERNAL]` → "N/A — External" | Annotated matrix data |
| 4 | ARCH-011 | Annotated matrix data + coverage percentages | Render Markdown table with column headers and row data | Matrix D section in `traceability-matrix.md` |

## Coverage Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Architecture Modules (ARCH) | 17 |
| Cross-Cutting Modules | 1 |
| Total Parent System Components Covered | 12 / 12 (100%) |
| Modules per Type | Component: 8 \| Service: 0 \| Library: 2 \| Utility: 7 \| Adapter: 0 |
| **Forward Coverage (SYS→ARCH)** | **100%** |

## Derived Modules

None — all modules trace to existing system components or are tagged `[CROSS-CUTTING]` with rationale.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| IEEE 42010 | Systems and Software Engineering — Architecture Description. Framework for documenting architecture viewpoints and views. |
| Kruchten's 4+1 View Model | Four mandatory architecture views (Logical, Process, Interface, Data Flow) plus scenarios. |
| ARCH-NNN | Architecture module identifier (e.g., ARCH-001). Maps many-to-many with SYS-NNN, or tagged `[CROSS-CUTTING]` for infrastructure modules. |
| `[CROSS-CUTTING]` | Tag applied to infrastructure/utility ARCH modules that serve the system as a whole rather than tracing to a specific SYS component. |
| `[EXTERNAL]` | Single canonical tag for third-party library wrappers. MOD documents wrapper only; UTP coverage bypassed in validation. `[COTS]` not recognized. |
| `[DERIVED MODULE]` | Flag for modules not traceable to any parent system component. Must be flagged, not silently added. |
| Strict Translator Constraint | Rule prohibiting the AI from inventing capabilities not present in the source artifact. |
| Partial Validation | Mode where `validate-module-coverage.sh` validates forward coverage (ARCH→MOD) only when `unit-test.md` is absent. |
