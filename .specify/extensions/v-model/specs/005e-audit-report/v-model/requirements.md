# V-Model Requirements Specification: Release Audit Report

**Feature Branch**: `feature/005e-audit-report`
**Created**: 2026-04-05
**Status**: Approved
**Source**: `specs/005e-audit-report/spec.md`

## Overview

This document formalizes the requirements for adding a `/speckit.v-model.audit-report` command to the V-Model Extension Pack. The command is a **100% deterministic script** (no AI) that collects all V-Model artifacts, coverage metrics, test execution results, hazard status, and anomaly justifications from a project's V-Model directory, then assembles a monolithic `release-audit-report.md` via template-fill. A `waivers.md` file documents accepted deviations (WAV-NNN entries) that are cross-referenced against failed/skipped tests and open peer-review findings to compute compliance status. Exit codes signal release readiness: 0 = RELEASE READY or RELEASE CANDIDATE, 1 = NOT READY (unwaived anomalies), 2 = error (missing required artifacts).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Rationale | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | The command SHALL accept a V-Model directory path as the primary positional argument and discover all V-Model artifacts within it (requirements.md, acceptance-plan.md, system-design.md, system-test.md, architecture-design.md, integration-test.md, module-design.md, unit-test.md, hazard-analysis.md, traceability-matrix.md, waivers.md). | P1 | The V-Model directory is the single source of all compliance evidence; automated discovery eliminates manual file listing. | Test |
| REQ-002 | For each discovered artifact, the command SHALL extract its Git SHA (abbreviated 7-character commit hash from the last commit that modified the file) and last-modified date (ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD from the commit timestamp). | P1 | Git-pinned evidence ensures every artifact in the audit report is traceable to a specific code revision, as required by auditors. | Test |
| REQ-003 | The command SHALL generate an Artifact Inventory table (Section 2) listing each discovered artifact with columns: Artifact name, File path, Git SHA, Last Modified date, and Status. | P1 | The artifact inventory provides the auditor with a complete manifest of all V-Model evidence documents and their revision state. | Test |
| REQ-004 | The command SHALL extract all traceability matrices (A, B, C, D, and H when present) from `traceability-matrix.md` and embed them in the report (Section 3), preserving any test execution status columns (Status, Date, Commit, Coverage). | P1 | The traceability matrices are the core evidence of bidirectional traceability across all V-Model levels. | Test |
| REQ-005 | The command SHALL compute coverage analysis metrics (Section 4) for each matrix: forward coverage (% of design IDs with at least one test), backward coverage (% of test IDs traced to a design ID), gap count (design IDs with no tests), and orphan count (test IDs with no parent design ID). | P1 | Coverage analysis quantifies traceability completeness and identifies gaps that could block certification. | Test |
| REQ-006 | When `hazard-analysis.md` exists, the command SHALL extract all HAZ-NNN entries and generate a Hazard Management Summary (Section 5) showing each hazard's Failure Mode, Severity, Likelihood, Risk Level, Mitigation, and Residual Risk. | P1 | Hazard management evidence is required by ISO 14971 (medical), ISO 26262 (automotive), and DO-178C (aerospace) for release certification. | Test |
| REQ-007 | The command SHALL identify all anomalies: test scenarios with `❌ Failed` status, test scenarios with `⏭️ Skipped` status, and (when `peer-review-*.md` files exist) peer-review findings with Critical or Major severity. | P1 | Anomaly identification is the prerequisite for waiver cross-referencing and release gating. | Test |
| REQ-008 | When `waivers.md` exists, the command SHALL parse it for WAV-NNN entries by matching `### WAV-NNN` headings and extracting the `**Artifact**:` field to identify which artifact ID each waiver covers. | P1 | Waiver parsing enables automated cross-referencing between documented justifications and actual anomalies. | Test |
| REQ-009 | For each identified anomaly, the command SHALL check if a matching waiver exists in `waivers.md` (by matching the anomaly's artifact ID against the waiver's `**Artifact**:` field). Anomalies with matching waivers SHALL be listed as "Waived" in the Known Anomalies section (Section 6); anomalies WITHOUT matching waivers SHALL be listed as "BLOCKING". | P1 | Strict waiver matching ensures no anomaly passes into a release without documented justification, as required by regulatory standards. | Test |
| REQ-010 | The command SHALL compute the compliance status based on anomaly disposition: `✅ RELEASE READY` when zero anomalies exist; `✅ RELEASE CANDIDATE` when all anomalies have matching waivers; `❌ NOT READY` when at least one anomaly has no matching waiver. | P1 | The compliance status is the top-level go/no-go signal for release certification — auditors look at this first. | Test |
| REQ-011 | The command SHALL generate an Executive Summary (Section 1) containing: system name, version, Git tag, date, regulatory context, total requirement count, total test scenario count, pass/fail/skip counts, hazard count with mitigation status, anomaly count with waiver status, and the computed compliance status. | P1 | The executive summary provides a one-page overview that auditors read first to determine release readiness. | Test |
| REQ-012 | The command SHALL generate a Signature Block (Section 7) with blank signature lines for QA Manager and Lead Engineer, plus the Git tag, Git SHA, and generation date. | P2 | The signature block provides the formal approval structure required by regulatory submission processes. | Test |
| REQ-013 | The command SHALL accept a `--system-name` argument for the system name, a `--version` argument for the release version, a `--git-tag` argument for the release tag, and a `--regulatory-context` argument for the applicable standards. | P1 | These metadata fields populate the executive summary and signature block with project-specific information. | Test |
| REQ-014 | The command SHALL accept an `--output` argument specifying the output file path. If not provided, the default SHALL be `release-audit-report.md` in the V-Model directory. | P2 | Explicit output path supports CI pipelines that write artifacts to specific locations. | Test |
| REQ-015 | The command SHALL return exit code 0 when the compliance status is `✅ RELEASE READY` or `✅ RELEASE CANDIDATE`. | P1 | Exit code 0 signals the release is not blocked, allowing CI pipelines to proceed. | Test |
| REQ-016 | The command SHALL return exit code 1 when the compliance status is `❌ NOT READY` (unwaived anomalies detected). | P1 | Exit code 1 blocks the CI pipeline, preventing release of software with unresolved anomalies. | Test |
| REQ-017 | The command SHALL return exit code 2 when required artifacts are missing (at minimum: `requirements.md` and `traceability-matrix.md` must exist). | P1 | Exit code 2 signals configuration error — the V-Model directory is incomplete and cannot produce a meaningful audit report. | Test |
| REQ-018 | The command SHALL support a `--json` flag that outputs the complete audit data as structured JSON to stdout, including: artifact inventory, coverage metrics per matrix, anomaly list with waiver status, compliance status, and all metadata. | P1 | Machine-readable JSON enables CI dashboards, approval gates, and downstream tooling to consume audit data programmatically. | Test |
| REQ-019 | When `waivers.md` contains a WAV-NNN entry whose `**Artifact**:` ID does not match any actual anomaly, the command SHALL report that waiver as "Orphaned" in the Known Anomalies section without affecting the compliance status. | P2 | Orphaned waivers indicate stale justifications that should be cleaned up but do not block releases. | Test |
| REQ-020 | The command SHALL print a human-readable summary to stderr showing: artifact count, matrix count, total coverage percentage, total test count with pass/fail/skip breakdown, anomaly count with waived/blocking breakdown, and the final compliance status. | P1 | The summary provides immediate feedback to engineers on the report result without requiring them to open the generated file. | Test |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Rationale | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-NF-001 | The command SHALL be 100% deterministic: given the same V-Model directory contents and Git history, it SHALL always produce the same audit report. | P1 | Deterministic behavior ensures reproducible audit evidence — two runs on the same inputs must produce identical reports. | Test |
| REQ-NF-002 | The script SHALL use only standard tools available on CI runners: Bash 4+, PowerShell 7+, Git, and optionally Python 3.x (standard library only). | P1 | Zero external dependencies ensure the script runs on any CI environment without additional setup. | Inspection |
| REQ-NF-003 | The command SHALL generate the complete audit report in under 30 seconds for a project with up to 500 V-Model IDs across all artifacts. | P3 | Performance requirement ensures the script does not become a CI bottleneck. | Test |

### Interface Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Rationale | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-IF-001 | The Bash script SHALL accept the following CLI syntax: `build-audit-report.sh <vmodel-dir> [--system-name <name>] [--version <ver>] [--git-tag <tag>] [--regulatory-context <ctx>] [--output <path>] [--json] [--help]`. | P1 | Consistent CLI interface with positional V-Model directory and named optional arguments. | Test |
| REQ-IF-002 | The PowerShell script SHALL accept equivalent parameters: `Build-Audit-Report.ps1 -VModelDir <path> [-SystemName <name>] [-Version <ver>] [-GitTag <tag>] [-RegulatoryContext <ctx>] [-Output <path>] [-Json] [-Help]`. | P1 | PowerShell parity with idiomatic parameter naming conventions. | Test |

### Constraint Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Rationale | Verification Method |
|----|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| REQ-CN-001 | The command SHALL NOT use any AI or LLM — all processing SHALL be performed by deterministic script logic including template-fill, regex parsing, and Git metadata extraction. | P1 | The audit report is a compliance document; AI variability is unacceptable for reproducible regulatory evidence. | Inspection |
| REQ-CN-002 | The command SHALL NOT regenerate or modify any existing V-Model artifacts — it SHALL only read them to assemble the audit report. | P1 | The audit report is a read-only aggregation; modifying source artifacts would break their Git-pinned integrity. | Inspection |
| REQ-CN-003 | The waivers.md file SHALL follow a structured format: each waiver begins with a `### WAV-NNN` heading followed by fields `**Artifact**:`, `**Type**:`, `**Justification**:`, `**Approved By**:`, and optionally `**Engineering Change Order**:` and `**Compensating Control**:`. | P2 | A defined schema ensures the waiver file is parseable by the script and consistent across projects. | Inspection |
