## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added — New Commands

- **`hazard-analysis`** — ISO 14971/26262 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) with `HAZ-NNN` hazard identifiers, operational state awareness, severity × likelihood risk matrix, mitigation traceability to REQ/SYS IDs, and progressive deepening (append-only at architecture level)
  - `hazard-analysis-template.md` — FMEA table template with 10 columns
  - `validate-hazard-coverage.sh` / `validate-hazard-coverage.ps1` — Three-dimensional deterministic validator: forward (SYS→HAZ), backward (HAZ→REQ/SYS), and operational state consistency checks with `--partial` and `--json` flags
  - Matrix H (Hazard Traceability) in traceability matrix — HAZ → Mitigation → Verification linkage
  - HAZ-NNN ID pattern in `id_validator.py`
- **`impact-analysis`** — Deterministic change impact analysis that builds a dependency graph from all V-Model markdown artifacts and traverses it to identify suspect artifacts affected by a change
  - `--downward` (default), `--upward`, and `--full` bidirectional traversal modes
  - `--json` flag for CI integration (structured JSON with blast radius, suspect artifacts by level, re-validation order)
  - Multi-ID support, <2s for 500+ IDs across 10+ artifact files
  - `impact-analysis.sh` / `impact-analysis.ps1` — Bash and PowerShell scripts with awk-based graph parser and BFS traversal
- **`peer-review`** — AI-powered stateless linter for any V-Model artifact, evaluating against standards-based criteria (INCOSE, IEEE 1016/42010, ISO 29119, ISO 14971, DO-178C) and producing `PRF-{ARTIFACT}-NNN` findings with severity classifications (Critical, Major, Minor, Observation)
  - Stateless linting model: findings regenerated from scratch each run, like ESLint
  - `peer-review-check.sh` / `Peer-Review-Check.ps1` — CI parser scripts with exit codes: 0 (clean), 1 (Critical/Major — blocks PR), 2 (Minor — warning)
- **`test-results`** — 100% deterministic JUnit XML + Cobertura XML ingestor that updates the traceability matrix in-place, flipping `⬜ Untested` to `✅ Passed` / `❌ Failed` / `⏭️ Skipped` with Date, Commit SHA, and optional Coverage columns
  - `parse_test_results.py` — stdlib-only Python helper (xml.etree.ElementTree) with 5 modules
  - `ingest-test-results.sh` / `Ingest-Test-Results.ps1` — Bash and PowerShell wrappers (1:1 parity)
  - Coverage mapping via `coverage-map.yml` or convention-based matching from `module-design.md`
- **`audit-report`** — 100% deterministic release audit report builder that produces a point-in-time `release-audit-report.md` for regulatory submission
  - Artifact inventory, traceability matrix embedding, coverage analysis, hazard management summary
  - Anomaly detection with waiver cross-referencing via `waivers.md` (WAV-NNN entries)
  - Compliance gating: ✅ RELEASE READY / ⚠️ RELEASE CANDIDATE / ❌ NOT READY
  - `build-audit-report.sh` / `Build-Audit-Report.ps1` — Bash and PowerShell scripts (1:1 parity)

### Added — Release Enhancements

- `validate-level.sh` / `Validate-Level.ps1` — Dispatch wrapper that invokes the correct validator for any V-Model level (acceptance → requirement-coverage, system-test → system-coverage, integration-test → architecture-coverage, unit-test → module-coverage, hazard-analysis → hazard-coverage) with `--json` and `--partial` flag support
- Agent definitions (`.github/agents/`) for all 14 commands — previously only 3 existed (requirements, acceptance, trace); now all commands have full agent prompts
- Sample CI workflow template (`examples/github-actions/v-model-validation.yml`) — configurable GitHub Actions workflow with conditional validators, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, peer review check, and audit report generation
- 56 V-Model specification documents promoted from Draft to Approved across specs/002–005e

### Added — Test Infrastructure
