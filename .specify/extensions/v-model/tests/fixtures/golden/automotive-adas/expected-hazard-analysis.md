# Hazard Analysis (FMEA): Automatic Emergency Braking System (AEB)

**Feature Branch**: `automotive-adas`
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Source**: `tests/fixtures/golden/automotive-adas/expected-system-design.md`
**Standard**: ISO 26262 (Automotive HARA)

## Overview

This document presents the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for the Automatic
Emergency Braking (AEB) system. Every system component (`SYS-NNN`) from `system-design.md`
is assessed for potential failure modes across the vehicle's operational states. Each hazard
receives a unique `HAZ-NNN` identifier and is linked to risk control measures (`REQ-NNN` /
`SYS-NNN`), enabling the traceability chain: Hazard → Mitigation → Requirement → Test Case
(Matrix H).

## ID Schema

- **Hazard ID**: `HAZ-{NNN}` — 3-digit zero-padded, sequential (HAZ-001, HAZ-002, ...)
- **ID Lineage**: From `HAZ-001`, read the Mitigation column to find `REQ-NNN` / `SYS-NNN`.

## Risk Matrix Definition

### Severity Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| Catastrophic | Death or permanent injury; complete vehicle loss of control |
| Critical | Severe injury or major vehicle damage; immediate intervention required |
| Serious | Moderate injury or significant degradation; medical attention needed |
| Minor | Slight injury or minor degradation; first aid sufficient |
| Negligible | No injury; cosmetic or inconvenience-level impact |

### Likelihood Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| Frequent | Likely to occur often; continuously experienced |
| Probable | Will occur several times; expected to occur |
| Occasional | Likely to occur sometime; can reasonably be expected |
| Remote | Unlikely but possible; could occur in the life of the system |
| Improbable | So unlikely it can be assumed it will not occur |

### Risk Matrix (Severity × Likelihood)

| | Frequent | Probable | Occasional | Remote | Improbable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Catastrophic** | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable |
| **Critical** | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable | Tolerable |
| **Serious** | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable | Tolerable | Tolerable |
| **Minor** | Undesirable | Tolerable | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable |
| **Negligible** | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable |
