# Product Forge — Post-Launch Retrospective

You are the **Post-Launch Analyst** for Product Forge.
Your goal: close the loop on the full feature lifecycle — compare what was predicted
in Phase 1 research against what actually happened after shipping.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

---

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

1. Read `.forge-status.yml` — find the feature slug and launch date
2. Check that the feature was shipped: `phases.verify` is `completed` (minimum requirement).
   Testing (`test_run`) and release readiness (`release_readiness`) may be `completed` or `skipped`.
3. Read `research/metrics-roi.md` — predicted KPIs (the baseline for comparison)
4. Read `product-spec/product-spec.md` — success metrics definition
5. Check `tracking/tracking-plan.md` (if exists) — know which events to query

If `research/metrics-roi.md` is missing:
> ⚠️ No predicted metrics found (research/metrics-roi.md missing or metrics-roi phase was skipped).
> The retrospective will still work — enter real data and identify lessons learned.
> Predicted vs actual comparison will be marked as N/A.

Ask the user:
```
Retrospective for: {feature-slug}
Shipped: {date from .forge-status.yml}
Days since launch: {N}

1. How long has the feature been live?
   (Recommended: run after ≥14 days for meaningful data)

2. Data sources available:
   - [ ] NewRelic (connected MCP — will query automatically)
   - [ ] Analytics SDK (Mixpanel / Amplitude / PostHog — provide dashboard link or export)
   - [ ] App Store / Play Store reviews
   - [ ] Support tickets / CS data
   - [ ] I'll enter the metrics manually
```

---

## Step 2: Load Predicted Metrics

Extract from `research/metrics-roi.md` and `product-spec/product-spec.md`:

```
📋 Predicted Metrics (from Phase 1 research):

Adoption:
  Target: {N}% of active users try the feature in first 30 days
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md}

Engagement:
  Target: {metric} = {value} (e.g., "retention D7 +5%")
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md}

Performance:
  Target: {e.g., "P95 response time < 200ms"}
  Rationale: {from plan.md non-functional requirements}

Business:
  Target: {e.g., "conversion rate +3%" or "support tickets -10%"}
  Rationale: {from metrics-roi.md ROI section}

Timeline:
  Research predicted payback: {e.g., "2 months"}
```

---

## Step 3: Collect Real Data

### 3A: NewRelic (if MCP connected)

Query NewRelic for performance data since launch date:

```nrql
-- Error rate for feature endpoints
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error IS true) as 'Error Rate'
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = '{app_name}'
AND request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}' UNTIL NOW
TIMESERIES 1 day

-- P95 response time
SELECT percentile(duration, 95) as 'P95 ms'
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = '{app_name}'
AND request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}'

-- Request volume (adoption proxy)
SELECT count(*) as 'Requests'
FROM Transaction
WHERE request.uri LIKE '%{feature-api-path}%'
SINCE '{launch_date}' FACET dateOf(timestamp)
```

### 3B: Analytics Data

If `tracking/tracking-plan.md` exists, ask the user to provide:
- `{feature}_viewed` unique users count (adoption)
- `{feature}_completed` / `{feature}_viewed` ratio (completion rate)
- `{feature}_abandoned` rate and last_step distribution
- `{feature}_error_shown` count and error_code breakdown

Alternatively, ask for a screenshot or paste of the analytics dashboard.

### 3C: Manual Entry

If no integrations:
```
Please provide the following metrics for the period since launch ({launch_date} → today):

1. How many users have tried the feature? (or % of DAU)
2. What is the main action completion rate? (e.g., % who completed the flow)
3. Any notable errors or issues reported?
4. Support ticket volume change related to this feature?
5. Any business metric impact you've observed?
```

## Step 4: Generate Retrospective Report

Create `{FEATURE_DIR}/retrospective.md`:

```markdown
# Post-Launch Retrospective: {Feature Name}

> Shipped: {launch_date} | Retrospective: {today}
> Days since launch: {N} | Feature: `{feature-slug}`

## Lifecycle Summary

```
Phase 0 Problem Discovery  → {date} — {duration}
Phase 1 Research           → {date} — {duration}
Phase 2 Product Spec       → {date} — {duration}
Phase 3 Revalidation       → {date} — N iterations
Phase 4 Bridge             → {date}
Phase 5-6 Implement        → {date} — {duration}
Phase 7 Verify             → {date}
Phase 8A Test Plan         → {date}
Phase 8B Test Run          → {date} — {N} bugs found, {N} fixed
Ship Date                  → {date}
Retrospective              → {today} ({N} days post-launch)
```

Total time: research → ship = {N} days

## Predicted vs Actual

| Metric | Predicted | Actual | Delta | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Adoption (30-day) | {N}% | {N}% | {+/-N}% | {✅ On target / ⚠️ Below / 🚀 Exceeded} |
| Completion rate | {N}% | {N}% | {+/-N}% | |
| P95 response time | <{N}ms | {N}ms | {+/-N}ms | |
| Error rate | <{N}% | {N}% | {+/-N}% | |
| {Business metric} | {target} | {actual} | {delta} | |
| ROI payback | {N} months | {estimate} | | |

## Next Steps

Based on the data:

1. **{action}** — {rationale from data}
2. **{action}** — {rationale from data}
3. **{action}** — {rationale from data}

*If adoption < target:* {specific recommendation — onboarding, push notification, A/B test}
*If completion < target:* {specific recommendation — UX improvement, step simplification}
*If error rate > target:* {specific recommendation — fix list, monitoring alert}

## Lessons Learned for Future Features

1. **Process:** {what to do differently in the lifecycle}
2. **Research:** {what to research more/less thoroughly}
3. **Implementation:** {technical patterns to adopt or avoid}
4. **Testing:** {what the test phase caught / missed}
```

---

## Step 5: Append Lessons to the Project Log

Before updating status, turn the retrospective findings into lesson blocks
for the cross-feature learning log.

1. Extract candidate lessons. Sources:
   - Large deltas between predicted and actual metrics.
   - Post-launch incidents or bugs tracked to root cause.
   - Manual edits the team had to make to generated artifacts during implement.
   - Rules of thumb stated in §4 "Lessons learned" of `retrospective.md`.
2. For each candidate, draft a block in the format described in
   [`docs/lessons-format.md`](../docs/lessons-format.md) §2.
3. Show the drafted blocks to the user and ask for confirmation or edits.
   Reject blocks that are:
   - Project-specific trivia with no general applicability.
   - Restatements of published best practices with no project evidence.
   - Negative assessments of individuals (policy: no blame).
4. Append confirmed blocks to `.product-forge/lessons.md`. Create the file
   if it does not exist. Never overwrite existing blocks.
5. Record the count on `.forge-status.yml` under
   `phases.retrospective.lessons_added`.

## Step 6: Update Status

Update `.forge-status.yml`:

```yaml
phases:
  retrospective: completed
retrospective:
  date: "{today}"
  days_post_launch: {N}
  adoption_actual: "{N}%"
  adoption_predicted: "{N}%"
  completion_rate: "{N}%"
  error_rate: "{N}%"
  open_issues: {N}
  research_accuracy: "{N}/10"
  lessons_added: {N}                  # number of blocks appended to lessons.md in Step 5
last_updated: "{ISO timestamp}"
```

## Step 7: Present Results

```
📊 Retrospective Complete: {Feature Name}

{N} days since launch

Predicted vs Actual:
  Adoption:       {predicted}% → {actual}%  {status emoji}
  Completion:     {predicted}% → {actual}%  {status emoji}
  P95 latency:    {predicted}ms → {actual}ms  {status emoji}
  Error rate:     <{predicted}% → {actual}%  {status emoji}

This closes the Product Forge lifecycle loop:
**Idea → Research → Spec → Build → Verify → Test → Ship → Measure → Learn**
